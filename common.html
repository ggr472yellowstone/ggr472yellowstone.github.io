                Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves (/ˈeɪviːz/), 
                characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a 
                high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a strong yet lightweight skeleton. Birds 
                live worldwide and range in size from the 5.5 cm (2.2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.8 m 
                (9 ft 2 in) common ostrich. There are over 11,000 living species, more than half of which 
                are passerine, or "perching" birds. Birds have wings whose development varies according to 
                species; the only known groups without wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds. Wings, 
                which are modified forelimbs, gave birds the ability to fly, although further evolution has 
                led to the loss of flight in some birds, including ratites, penguins, and diverse endemic
                island species.
