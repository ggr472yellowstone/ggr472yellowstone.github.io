               <h2>Bufflehead Duck - Bucephala Albeola<br></h2>
                        The Bufflehead duck is a breeding species in Yellowstone. It most commonly lives and breeds by lakes, rivers, and bays in Northwestern America. They are the smallest diving ducks in North America and forage for food underwater and eat insects, snails, and water plants. These ducks are found in small flocks and migrate together towards the coasts as winter rolls in. You might think the name ‘Bufflehead Duck’ sounds funny, but it describes the shape of the duck's large head!
