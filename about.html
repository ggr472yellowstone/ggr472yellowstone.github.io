    <h1>About</h1>
    <div class = 'box'>
        <h2>Objective(s) and Motivations:</h2>
        <p>
            The authors of this website are finishing up their final years in the 
            GIS program at the University of Toronto. In the past our group work has 
            focussed mainly on the greater Toronto area. For this project we endeavored 
            to change that. We present to you the Yellowstone Birder's Guide! The birding hobby 
            - in which people undertake a serious effort to observe different bird species- 
            is commonplace across the national parks of the United States. Focussing on one 
            national park, the purpose of this project is to help birders plan bird watching 
            trips into Yellowstone. The website displays a basemap with the borders of Yellowstone 
            national park and its established trails. A GeoJSON with bird sightings for over 21 unique 
            bird species can be displayed and queried for different seasons and years. The Turf.js API 
            was leveraged to show areas where there are large amounts of bird sightings. Users can also 
            navigate to other tabs to learn about the bird species shown on this website.
        </p>
        <h2>Data Acquisition:</h2>
        <p>
            The web mapping elements of this website are supported by a large amount of data of over 
            12,000 individual bird sightings for 21 different bird species. The database was constructed 
            using the GBIF API. GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) is an international repository 
            that contains species distribution and occurrence datasets for hundreds of thousands of species. 
            To date, the facility has an occurrence dataset of almost 3 billion georeferenced data points. 
            We used the GBIF API to query this massive online dataset for sightings of the most common, most 
            endangered, and most monitored bird species found in Yellowstone. We also filtered out sightings 
            from before the year 2000. Finally, the datasets were merged into one large shapefile which was 
            then exported into GeoJSON format.
        </p>
        <h2>Data Bias:</h2>
        <p>
            There are some important biases and disclaimers that should be understood when viewing this dataset. 
            This web map is not displaying habitat distribution models. The information provided in this web map 
            is only the sightings of specific bird species. Therefore there is a noticeable location bias to the 
            most well traveled trails in Yellowstone. Lastly, this website does not interface directly with the 
            GBIF library, therefore, no new bird sightings are appended to the dataset in real time.
