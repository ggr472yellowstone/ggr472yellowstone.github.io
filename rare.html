    <h1>Rare Species</h1>

        <div class = 'box-row'>
            <h2>Pinyon Jay - Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus<br></h2>
            <p class = 'box-left-txt'>
                The Pinyon Jay nests in trees located in open woodland areas. These birds forage for insects, seeds, berries, and very small animals on the ground. 
                They fly in large loud groups and are members of permanent flocks that can contain around 500 birds. The Pinyon Jays estimated breeding population is 690,000 due to the degradation of their Pinyon-juniper forest habitat. 
                So, if you see a small gray-blue bird with a brighter blue head, consider yourself a lucky birder! <br>
            </p>
            <h2>Boreal Owl - Aegolius funereus<br></h2>
            <p>
                The Boreal Owl is a breeding species in Yellowstone National Park named for their time spent in Boreal forests. These owls hunt during the nighttime and eat small mammals. The female Boreal Owl is much larger and heavier than the male. 
                Mated pairs meet only for courting and feeding. These owls are found across North America and Eurasia, being partly migratory during seasons of prey scarcity like the winter, flying south.

                <h2>Black-backed Woodpecker - Picoides arcticus<br></h2>
                    <p>
                        The Black-Backed Woodpecker is a breeding species in Yellowstone National Park. These birds seek out burned forests that have recently been affected by a forest fire in order to live off of the bounty of insects this brings. 
                        Like other woodpecker species, the Black-backed Woodpecker excavates its nest itself out of wood, creating a nest cavity. <br>
                    </p>
                <h2>House Finch - Haemorhous mexicanus<br></h2>
                <p>
                    The House Finch is a small and strictly vegetarian bird, sticking to a diet of berries and seeds. These small birds can also drink up to 40% of their weight in water, so you are likely to find them attracted to water sources. 
                    The House Finch is native to the Western United States, but after being smuggled from California to New York in the 40â€™s became more prevalent in the East and all across North America.
