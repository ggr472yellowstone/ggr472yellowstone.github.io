            <h2>Pinyon Jay - Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus<br></h2>
            <p class = 'box-left-txt'>
                The Pinyon Jay nests in trees located in open woodland areas. These birds forage for insects, seeds, berries, and very small animals on the ground. 
                They fly in large loud groups and are members of permanent flocks that can contain around 500 birds. The Pinyon Jays estimated breeding population is 690,000 due to the degradation of their Pinyon-juniper forest habitat. 
                So, if you see a small gray-blue bird with a brighter blue head, consider yourself a lucky birder! <br>

            <h2>Boreal Owl - Aegolius funereus<br></h2>
            <p class = 'box-left-txt'>
                The Boreal Owl is a breeding species in Yellowstone National Park named for their time spent in Boreal forests. These owls hunt during the nighttime and eat small mammals. The female Boreal Owl is much larger and heavier than the male. 
                Mated pairs meet only for courting and feeding. These owls are found across North America and Eurasia, being partly migratory during seasons of prey scarcity like the winter, flying south.

                Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves (/ˈeɪviːz/), 
                characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a 
                high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a strong yet lightweight skeleton. Birds 
                live worldwide and range in size from the 5.5 cm (2.2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.8 m 
                (9 ft 2 in) common ostrich. There are over 11,000 living species, more than half of which 
                are passerine, or "perching" birds. Birds have wings whose development varies according to 
                species; the only known groups without wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds. Wings, 
                which are modified forelimbs, gave birds the ability to fly, although further evolution has 
                led to the loss of flight in some birds, including ratites, penguins, and diverse endemic
                island species.
