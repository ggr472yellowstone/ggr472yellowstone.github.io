Statement of intent: 
The Yellowstone Birder's Guide is an online web map whose purpose is to guide and inform Birders on bird watching trips to Yellowstone National Park (YNP).


How to use:
Users of this web map can view the distribution of bird sightings for 1 or many of the 21 unique bird species listed on our website. There are three buttons listed on the tope left corner of the map : Show Spottings, Show Legend, and Filter by Time.
The legend pertains to the density of all bird sightings regardless of species within an area. A user can filter by time to view bird sightings within a particular year.

In addition to the sighting occurences, a user may access the other web pages to learn about the different bird species shown in our web map. Currently, we have informational pages for three categories of birds: Most Common, Most Rare, and Monitored Species.

Most Common: taken from the YNP bird checklist, only the birds that are labeled ‘Common’ in every season
Most Rare: taken from the YNP bird checklist, only the birds that are labeled ‘Rare’ in every season
Monitored: Yellowstone’s bird species of concern (monitoring programs in place)

Finally, the about page mentions some important disclaimers about the data as well as links to access the database used to build our website which we compiled from GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility).
